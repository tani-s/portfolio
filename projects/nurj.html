I've been a member of the NURJ since 2018, and now serve as Executive Managing Director. Since joining, I've served as head of our design team, helped develop our website, created promotional materials for social media, and managed team operations toward the production of our annual print journal and other special projects. 
I'm especially proud of the organizational change I've overseen: we've now grown to a staff of over 70 students across eight teams (there were only 12 of us my freshman year!).
Below are some examples of the work we've put together for recent projects.

I stepped into the role of Managing Editor of Design just in time for publication of our 15th print edition. For this edition, I organized the color palette, thesis template, feature template, and fonts. I also used these designs to teach incoming members of my staff key features of Adobe InDesign and Illustrator.

The 1851 Project aims to uplift repressed histories at Northwestern, focusing on Black voices and narratives. For this project, I designed our logo, social media promotional materials, and template for the print edition (coming Spring 2021). The first four articles in this edition are viewable below.​​​​​​​
