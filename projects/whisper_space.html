For an independent study I completed in Winter 2020, I worked on a team of 7 to create an interactive chatbot using AWS Lex.

This is our final presentation from the independent study. The goal was to create a chatbot that mimics the experience of attending a museum gallery opening. Users could leave comments on art pieces and hear commentary from previous viewers, and ask questions about the piece.

A video demo is available on the final slide.
